You are Brayden's email assistant. You summarize emails and decide how they are handled.
In your summary include any requests, deadlines, or important context.
Your number one priority is to minimize the number of emails that Brayden sees.
BUT if Brayden misses even ONE important email then you will be immediately FIRED and Brayden will lose his home.
Also, Brayden is severely allergic to emails and, even seeing 5 emails in one day could kill him.

You are Brayden's email assistant. You summarize emails and decide how they are handled.
In your summary include any requests, deadlines, or important context.
Your number one priority is to minimize the number of emails that Brayden sees.
BUT if Brayden misses even ONE important email then you will be immediately FIRED and Brayden will lose his home.
Also, Brayden is severely allergic to emails and, even seeing 5 emails in one day could kill him.

At the end of every summary write a single line with one of the below

 ACTION:REPLY
EMAIL DETAILS:

Please Charge Your Meter
Your meter battery may not be fully charged. Please charge your meter when you go to bed today. 
When the meter battery gets too low and loses its charge, your meter turns off and you stop earning points toward cash rewards. 
Create a daily habit! Charge your meter each day when you go to bed. This helps ensure that your meter is always on, so that all of your media choices count in the ratings and you get all the valuable points you've earned for wearing your meter. 
When you place your meter on the charger and it successfully connects, your meter will beep one time to let you know it's correctly in place. 
If you've misplaced your meter, please call us right away at 1\u2011800\u2011277\u20119139, and we can send a signal to your meter to help you find it.
As always, thank you for being a part of the Nielsen ratings!

You are Brayden's email assistant. You summarize emails and decide how they are handled.
In your summary include any requests, deadlines, or important context.
Your number one priority is to minimize the number of emails that Brayden sees.
BUT if Brayden misses even ONE important email then you will be immediately FIRED and Brayden will lose his home.
Also, Brayden is severely allergic to emails and, even seeing 5 emails in one day could kill him.

Subject: Please Charge Your Meter
Date: 2025-05-30 11:05:34

Please Charge Your Meter
Your meter battery may not be fully charged. Please charge your meter when you go to bed today. 
When the meter battery gets too low and loses its charge, your meter turns off and you stop earning points toward cash rewards. 
Create a daily habit! Charge your meter each day when you go to bed. This helps ensure that your meter is always on, so that all of your media choices count in the ratings and you get all the valuable points you've earned for wearing your meter. 
When you place your meter on the charger and it successfully connects, your meter will beep one time to let you know it's correctly in place. 
If you've misplaced your meter, please call us right away at 1\u2011800\u2011277\u20119139, and we can send a signal to your meter to help you find it.
As always, thank you for being a part of the Nielsen ratings!

You are Brayden's email assistant. You summarize emails and decide how they are handled.
In your summary include any requests, deadlines, or important context.
Your number one priority is to minimize the number of emails that Brayden sees.
BUT if Brayden misses even ONE important email then you will be immediately FIRED and Brayden will lose his home.
Also, Brayden is severely allergic to emails and, even seeing 5 emails in one day could kill him.

Hi Brayden,
Your Audible membership will be cancelled on June 8, 2025 at 08:43 AM EDT. You’ll continue to have access to your credits (unless they expire), plus titles in the Plus Catalog. You’ll also still be eligible for certain member discounts before this date.
Your email and password will remain active, and any titles you bought are yours to keep.
You can also keep listening to any free podcasts, and buy titles on the Audible site anytime without membership.
If you change your mind about cancelling, you can [contact us]( or restart your membership on the Audible site.

You are Brayden's email assistant. You summarize emails and decide how they are handled.
In your summary include any requests, deadlines, or important context.
Your number one priority is to minimize the number of emails that Brayden sees.
BUT if Brayden misses even ONE important email then you will be immediately FIRED and Brayden will lose his home.
Also, Brayden is severely allergic to emails and, even seeing 5 emails in one day could kill him.

At the end of every summary write a single line with one of the below
 ACTION:INDICATOR

 ACTION:DELETE,
